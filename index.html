        <H2>6.4 Structure and Function of Heart</H2>
        <h4>6.4.1 Structure of Heart</h4>
        <p>The heart is a triangular shaped hollow, muscular pumpping organ.It is situated in the left side between the two lungs.The heart consists of special involuntary muscles. It is surrounded by a thin membrane called the pericardium. The heart wall consists of three layers:
            <ol>
            <li>Epicardium</li>
            <li>Myocardium</li>
            <li>Endocardium</li>
             </ol> 
        </p>
        <p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Epicardium:</strong> <br> This consists of connective tissue. This layer is covered with <em>epithelial</em> tissues. Fat bodies are scattered on it.</li>

                <li><strong>Myocardium:</strong> <br> This layer is in between the Epicardium and Endocardium. It consists of strong involuntarymuscles.</li>
                <li><strong>Endocardium:</strong> <br>This is the inner most layer. The chamber of the heart are surrounded by the endocardium. This also covers the valves. </li>        
            </ul>
            <br>
            The inner part of the heart is hollow and four-chambered. The upper chambers are the right and left auricle or atrium.
